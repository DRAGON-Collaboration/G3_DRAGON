C variables for gammahit ntuple
C recoil_hit_ENDV, flag for each event, equals 1 if recoild reached ENDV
C num_bgos_hit, num of BGOs triggered during event
C e_bgos_total, summed energy deposited in all BGOs
C num_bgo_first/second, ID# of leading/second leading BGO
C e_bgo_first/second, energy deposited in leading/second leading BGO
C pair_productions, number of pairs produced in event
C _ab, adding back of nearest neighbours used to calculate
C adjacency_matrix, element (i,j) = 1 if BGOs i and j are neighbours
